The idea here is to pick something I could "easily" do, and keep doing it to
refine the process until it is second nature. Eventually I want to build to
bigger projects in areas where I require the most fluency.


## projects


### GroupByHaskell

In this project, I am practicing building an entire haskell project for a `GroupBy` module,
working around a simple utility function and module in order to drill components
of Haskell/GHC/Stack.
